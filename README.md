This project is a set of resources for recovering Floppy Disk Media
The target media can be used on Mac, Amiga, Atari etc but the focus was restoring media using a modern PC with Windows 11 but a USB floppy disk
The simple batch files here need no additional binaries 
Programs like Tee.exe are just included in case you want to log the output to a file.

There are 2 files
d.bat that formats a floppy disk and attempts recovery/reports the status of the disk and recovery
jTtimestamp an excellent library https://www.dostips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=7523&start=15
